# Cluster and Form

> An intelligent team formation system that transforms the tedious process of organizing university activities into an automated, constraint-aware, and friend-preference-respecting solution.

A powerful tool for organizing university activities by automatically forming balanced teams while respecting friend preferences and team constraints.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Organizing university activities often requires forming teams with multiple constraints:
- Teams should have roughly equal sizes
- Equal distribution of genders for fair play
- Mix of students from different university years
- Respect friend preferences when possible

Manually forming teams while considering all these constraints is time-consuming and error-prone. This tool automates the entire process, saving hours of manual work.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Excel Data Import**: Load participant data including names, phone numbers, types (leader/subleader), gender, year (dashID), and friend preferences
- **Smart Name Matching**: Automatically matches friend recommendations even with partial or slightly incorrect names
- **Interactive Friend Management**: Edit and verify friend connections through an intuitive table interface
- **Visual Cluster Analysis**: Interactive network graph visualization of friend clusters using pyvis and vis.js
- **Dynamic Graph Editing**: Add, delete, or modify connections directly in the graph view
- **Intelligent Team Formation**: Uses evolutionary programming to create balanced teams while respecting all constraints
- **Excel Export**: Generates color-coded Excel files with team assignments and cluster information

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üíª Usage

1. Prepare your Excel file with the following columns:
   - Name
   - Dash ID
   - Gender
   - Type
   - Number
   - Friend 1
   - Friend 2
